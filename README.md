# Exploratory Data Analysis - Lab

## Introduction
The lab is designed to be self-guided, providing solutions for each exercise to check your work and assist if you get stuck. However, it is important to first attempt to solve the problem on your own as this is the best way to learn. If you become stuck, don't give up and seek help from the instructor, peers, or even a search engine like Google. Be mindful that not all answers from a search engine may be correct, so use your judgement to determine the validity of the information. Remember, the best way to learn is to try solving the problem yourself first.

This lab is designed to help you practice exploratory data analysis using Python. You will work with one dataset: auto-mpg. You will use various data visualization and analysis techniques to gain insights and identify patterns in the data, and clean and preprocess the data to make it more suitable for analysis.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Load and preprocess data using Python libraries such as pandas
- Clean and preprocess the data to make it more suitable for analysis
- Use visualization techniques to explore and understand the distribution of the variables in the data
- Apply basic statistical analysis to derive insights from the data
- Communicate your findings through clear and effective data visualizations and summaries

## Installing Dependencies
This assignment does not assume any particular setup. To install the dependencies, please run the command relevant to you're setup.
- If you're using `pipenv`, run `pipenv install`
- if you're using `pip`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

ðŸ’­ Reflection and Self Assessment
# I learned: (repeat as needed)

- . How to load data with python libraries, how to clean up data for analysis, data visualization techniques, and analyzing the data visualization/statistics to come to certain conclusions regarding the data.

# I struggled with: (repeat as needed)

- . I struggled initially dropping certain values because I had made the recurring mistake of setting a new variable whenever auto_mpg_df was manipulated. I eventually fixed everything so that each manipulation of the data frame would update the data frame itself by using the inplace parameter, setting it to true.

# I need the instructor to help me with: (repeat as needed)

- . N/A (did not receive the instructors help for this assignment)

# How long did it take you to complete this assignment? and reflect on that [6] hours.
- . I think that it took me 6 hours to finish this mainly because of the recurring procedural mistake I made with the variables. It affected all the data that I tried to use after it, so I had to redo certain parts of the assignment.

# How often did you have to check the solution to the problem? How do you feel about that? 
- . I often didn't check the solutions because some of the topics covered through this lab have crossover with the other lab from this week. 

If I were to do this assignment again, I would: (repeat as needed)

. I would have tried to figure out how I could segment the dataframes based on data types earlier so that the rest of the assignment went smoother.
ðŸ’¯ Self Grade: For this assignment, based on my work and my reflections I should get [20] out of 20.
